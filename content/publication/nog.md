abstract = "We present a novel scheme for high-order harmonic generation, enabling the production of spatially separated isolated attosecond pulses. This can be achieved by driving the generation process with two identical, but temporally delayed laser pulses, which are noncollinearly overlapping in the generation medium. Our approach provides intense attosecond pulses directly separated from the fundamental field, which is left undistorted. The method is therefore ideally suited for pump-probe studies in the extreme ultraviolet regime and promises new advances for intra-cavity attosecond pulse generation. We present a theoretical description of noncollinear optical gating, with an analytical derivation and simulations using the strong field approximation."
